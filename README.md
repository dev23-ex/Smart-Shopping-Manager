# Smart-Shopping-Manager
Money is an important aspect of modern life. Managed well, you can save more and remain stable but if used poorly, results could be devastating. You need to optimize beforehand how to use your money to maximize efficiency.  Without proper attention, it can lead to overspending which would ultimately affect your short-term and long-term goals negatively.  But how to manage your money? That’s where ‘Smart Shopping Manager’ comes in. Using ‘Smart Shopping Manager’, you can shop accordingly without spending any reckless amount of money.
METHODOLGY
Here, we are using Agile Model and following are the steps:

	1.	Planning: The main requirement is that finances are needed to be managed to avoid excess expenditure. For money management, we are using Knapsack algorithm to optimize it and dynamic programming to tackle the Knapsack problem in an efficient manner.

	2.	Designing: Now, we need a program that can be used to reduce the reckless spending of money and better optimization of it.

	3.	Development: For the development of the program, Knapsack algorithm is used to optimize with Dynamic Programming in the program using Java.
	4.	Testing: And finally, during testing process, it gives desired output as a software which is able to calculate how to shop according to the needs of the user.

Algorithmic Approach
0-1 Knapsack Algorithm:
	1.	The 0/1 knapsack problem means that the items are either completely or no items are filled in a knapsack.In the 0–1 Knapsack problem, we are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and we need to determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
	2.	Parameters:
	�	Quantities of the items in terms of units, for example, 9 units.
	�	Items of the products’ name which user wants to buy.
	�	Values that decide the importance of the item.
	�	It picks up the item which does not exceed the default limit and the value of the items is maximized.
